Coding Samples
This particular sample demonstrates some unit tesing (using jasmine) on a simple NODE.JS CRUD service, using express.
I used version V10.13.0 of Node and Version 6.4.1 of NPM to create this project.
Checkout the package.json file for the version of the othe packages used. 
Once the project has all been setup (the original directory number to copy all the files to was node-test) then 
change directory to the node-test parent directory and run 'npm run test'.
There are 12 unit tests in total.
